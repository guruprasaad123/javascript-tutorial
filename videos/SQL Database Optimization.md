We can use deep reinforcement learning to optimize a SQL database, and in this video we'll optimize the ordering of a series of SQL queries such that it involves the minimum possible memory/computation footprint. Deep RL involves using a neural network to approximate reinforcement learning functions, like the Q (quality) function. After we frame our database as a Markov Decision Process, I'll use Python to build a Deep Q Network to optimize SQL queries. Enjoy!
