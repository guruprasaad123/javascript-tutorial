Nvidia is the inventor of the GPU! This tech company based in Silicon Valley has played a huge role in the deep learning revolution (which has relied primarily on GPUs for computing), and its transformed many industries. In this video, I interview Bryan Catanzaro, the Vice President of Applied Deep Learning Research at NVIDIA. Bryan got his PhD in AI from Berkeley, invented a language called Copperhead, and is an expert in parallel programming theory. Nvidia invited me to their annual conference, so I took the opportunity to ask Bryan 67 questions while walking through the halls. Enjoy!
