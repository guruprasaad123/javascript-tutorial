I've built a demo app called DharmaSecurity, a fraud detection tool for businesses. The way it works is that once signed up, a business will paste a code snippet into their website, and then they'll get access to a dashboard that tells them how many fraudulent accounts they have. Our app will use machine learning to automatically remove suspected fraud accounts, and flag likely ones for review. To build this, I use a suite of AWS tools, python, javascript, a logistic regression model, a credit card fraud dataset, and a library called openmined to enable federated learning and secure multiparty computation. I've packed a lot into this video, animations, code, music, screencasts, skits, etc. Enjoy!
