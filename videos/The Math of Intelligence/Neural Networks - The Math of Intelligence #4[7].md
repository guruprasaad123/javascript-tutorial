Have you ever wondered what the math behind neural networks looks like? What gives them such incredible power? We're going to cover 4 different neural networks in this video to develop an intuition around their basic principles (2 feedforward networks, 1 recurrent network, and a self-organizing map). Prepare yourself, deep learning is coming.
