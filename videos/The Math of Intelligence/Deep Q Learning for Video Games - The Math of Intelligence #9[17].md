We're going to replicate DeepMind's Deep Q Learning algorithm for Super Mario Bros! This bot will be able to play a bunch of different video games by using reinforcement learning. This is the first video in this series that uses libraries (Keras & Gym) because if it didn't, the code would be way too long for a short video. I'll make a longer, in-depth version without libraries soon. 

Code for this video:
