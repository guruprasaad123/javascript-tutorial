Welcome to The Math of Intelligence! In this 3 month course, we'll cover the most fundamental math concepts in Machine Learning. In this first lesson, we'll go over a very popular optimization technique called gradient descent to help us predict how many calories a cyclist would burn given just their distance traveled. We'll also follow the story of 2 data scientists as they attempt to find the Higgs-Boson (God particle) via anomaly detection. No collaborations, this is an independent course.
