Boston Dynamics released yet another incredible video of its bipedal humanoid robot, this time performing parkour by jumping on a series of boxes. In this video, i'll explain how it works at both a hardware and software level. Their real value lies in the specific type of software they are using, we don't know for sure what it is but we can take some educated guesses based on a combination of whats been revealed so far and what's worked in other humanoid robots. Prepare yourselves for some mechanical engineering and control theory Wizards, enjoy!
