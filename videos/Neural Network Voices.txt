Baidu has released some really impressive research that enables them to generate a voice in the style of anyone after having been trained on only a few examples. Few-shot generative learning is something i'm particularly interested in, and in this video I'll go over what their progress has looked like in this field over the past 2 years. We'll go over a web demo of audio generation, try and understand how DeepMind's WaveNet (similar) works, and then look at some Tensorflow code to get a deeper understanding of how this model plays out programmatically.
