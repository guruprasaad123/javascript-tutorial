I'm going to use a quantum processor to help accelerate and extend a machine learning algorithm! Thanks to D-Wave's Leap software, we can access a QPU in the browser. In this live stream, I'll explain how the Leap toolkit works, what a quantum processor offers machine learning engineers, and we'll go through a few relevant examples. Get hype!
