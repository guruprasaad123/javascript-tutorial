I've built a tool for teachers that automatically grades and validates essays using modified versions of popular language models, specifically BERT and GPT-2. It's called EssayBrain and I built it using the Python programming language, as well Flask, Tensorflow.js, Tensorflow, D3.js, CopyLeaks, Stripe, and Firebase. In this video tutorial, i'll guide you through my process as I build this project. The code is open source and I'll link to it below. Use it as inspiration to start your own profitable business in this space. We've got to upgrade education, and with the power of technology anyone anywhere can create a viable engineering solution that creates a positive impact. Enjoy!
