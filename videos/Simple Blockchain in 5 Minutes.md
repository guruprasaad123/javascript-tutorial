A blockchain is a data structure that was first introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in the Bitcoin protocol white paper almost a decade ago. Bitcoin's blockchain stores transaction data, but we can store any type of data in a blockchain. Ethereum, for example, enables users to store code snippets called 'smart contracts' in their blockchain. In this video, we'll build a simple blockchain in Python that uses proof-of-work consensus, just like the Bitcoin protocol does. There's a lot of misunderstanding around what the blockchain is and what it can do so I hope this demonstrates how simple it really is. Enjoy!
