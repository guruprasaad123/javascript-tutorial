Meta learning describes the concept of 'learning to learn'. What if we could have AI learn how to optimize itself? An AI could learn the optimal hyper-parameters, architecture, and even dataset! Its a really interesting topic, and in this video I'll describe some meta learning techniques and focus on one in particular; deep neuro-evolution. We'll build an image classifier using a deep neuro-evolutionary algorithm. Enjoy!
