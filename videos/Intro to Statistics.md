Statistics is crucial to Data Science! In fact, the phrase Data Science was first used in a Statistics conference title. In this video, I'll cover 3 key concepts from Statistics that every Data Scientist needs to know. Statistical features, probability distributions, and Bayesian statistics will be explained using code, theory, and animations. Our specific application will be finding an optimal credit score for someone using Lending Club's loan data. Expect a musical interlude. Enjoy!
