Welcome to AI Humanities! I'm going to review 10 books that I've recently read in this video. I've formed these books into a sequential curriculum that serve as an "AI Humanities" elective class at School of AI.  Literature Humanities was one of the few classes at Columbia I enjoyed, and I'm taking the structure that I learned there and evolving it into one dedicated to AI. These books have all helped me immensely in my brainstorming and ideation phases. I hope you find them useful too. Enjoy!
