Transfer learning is a statistical technique that's been getting more attention lately that enables you to reuse a model for a different task than what it was trained for. In this episode, Iâ€™m going to show you how to use transfer learning to predict instances of gold deposits using publicly available satellite imagery. We'll discuss the 4 different mathematical ways to frame the transfer learning problem, then look into how a U-Net architecture works. The U-Net is really popular for image segmentation and classification tasks on sites like Kaggle, so knowing how it works will be a useful skill. Enjoy!
