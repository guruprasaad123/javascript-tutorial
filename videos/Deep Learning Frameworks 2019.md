Which deep learning framework should you use? In this video I'll compare 10 deep learning frameworks across a wide variety of metrics. PyTorch, Tensorflow, MXNet, Chainer, CNTK, Sonnet, DeepLearning4J, CoreML, ONNX, we've got a lot to cover in this video! Using code, programmatic features, and theory, I'll navigate this field ultimately coming to some clear conclusions. Enjoy!
