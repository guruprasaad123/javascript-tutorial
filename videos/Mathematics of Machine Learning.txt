Do you need to know math to do machine learning? Yes! The big 4 math disciplines that make up machine learning are linear algebra, probability theory, calculus, and statistics. I'm going to cover how each are used by going through a linear regression problem that predicts the price of an apartment in NYC based on its price per square foot. Then we'll switch over to a logistic regression model to change it up a bit. This will be a hands-on way to see how each of these disciplines are used in the field.
