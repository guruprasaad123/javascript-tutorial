There are 7 math problems that each have a 1 million dollar prize attached to them by the Clay Mathematics Institute. Only 1 of these problems have been solved so far, meaning the other 6 are open to anyone in the world with the proper motivation to solve. In this episode, I'm going to explain how recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence can help an individual solve these problems and possibly win the prize money. There are 2 specific techniques I have in mind, the newly released "Ramanujan Machine" which can automatically generate conjectures, and the "Neural Reasoning" model by DeepMind. Both are relatively new papers, and I believe that we're beginning to see the building blocks of an entirely new frontier of mathematical discovery, where machines can help us discover mathematical principles in ways we couldn't alone. I'll explain it all here, enjoy! 

Spots are almost filled in my new Machine Learning course! Learn more here:

Coding Challenge!
Use the Ramanujan machine to create a conjecture for "pi" i.e 3.14. Here is the code, submit your github link in the comment section, I'll announce the winner in my next episode. Bonus points for great documentation. Good luck!
