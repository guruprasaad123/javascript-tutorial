I've designed a free natural language processing curriculum for anyone interested in improving their skills in order to start a startup, get consulting work, or find full-time work related to NLP. This curriculum is for beginners and starts with basic NLP terminology, then moves into basic language models and word embeddings. Then, it moves onto more advanced concepts like neural networks, sequence modeling and dialogue systems. At the end, I'll detail what the most experimental, modern-day techniques are in the field. I hope you find this curriculum useful!
