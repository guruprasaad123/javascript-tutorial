How does an autoencoder work? Autoencoders are a type of neural network that reconstructs the input data its given. But we don't care about the output, we care about the hidden representation its learned. Its a lower dimensional compression of the input that preserves its features. We can use this learned representation for tasks like image colorization, dialogue generation, and anomaly detection.
