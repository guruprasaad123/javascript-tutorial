I'm excited to announce that School of AI is now accepting applications for research fellows in 2019! We'll select 10 Fellows and give them 1K USD in Google Cloud credits each, a personal advisor, and help them submit their work to relevant academic outlets like NIPS and popular journals. The deadline for submissions is May 15 2019 and I look forward to your applications! Our 10 Fellows from 2018 did some amazing work, I'll explain what they did and give guidelines as to what we're looking for this round. Enjoy!
