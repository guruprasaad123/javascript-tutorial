The AI research lab DeepMind created an algorithm that beat a top professional StarCraft 2 player for the first time! This is a huge achievement since this is an incredibly complex game that requires long term planning, game theory, and cooperative play. Their algorithm used a mixture of techniques that in the field of deep reinforcement learning. I'll explain how each of these techniques works, and how they all work together in unison. This is an exciting time for the field. Enjoy!
