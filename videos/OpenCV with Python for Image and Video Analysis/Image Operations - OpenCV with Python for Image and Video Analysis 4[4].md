In this Python with OpenCV tutorial, we're going to cover some of the basics of simple image operations that we can do. Every video breaks down into frames. Each frame, like an image, then breaks down into pixels stored in rows and columns within the frame/picture. Each pixel has a coordinate location, and each pixel is comprised of color values. Let's work out some examples of accessing various bits of these principles.
