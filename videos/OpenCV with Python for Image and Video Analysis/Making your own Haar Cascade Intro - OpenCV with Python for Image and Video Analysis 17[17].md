Welcome to an object detection tutorial with OpenCV and Python. In this tutorial, you will be shown how to create your very own Haar Cascades, so you can track any object you want. Due to the nature and complexity of this task, this tutorial will be a bit longer than usual, but the reward is massive.

While you *can* do this in Windows, I would not suggest it. Thus, for this tutorial, I am going to be using a Linux VPS, and I recommend you do the same. You can try to use the free tier from Amazon Web Services, though it may be painfully too slow for you, and you will likely need more RAM. You can also get a VPS from Digital Ocean for as low as $5/month. I would recommend at least 2GB of RAM for what we will be doing. Most hosts nowadays charge by the hour, including Digital Ocean. Thus, you can buy a $20/mo server, use it for a day, take the files you want, and then terminate the server and pay a very small amount of money.
