Welcome to another OpenCV with Python tutorial, in this tutorial we're going to cover a fairly basic version of object recognition. The idea here is to find identical regions of an image that match a template we provide, giving a certain threshold. For exact object matches, with exact lighting/scale/angle, this can work great. An example where these conditions are usually met is just about any GUI on the computer. The buttons and such are always the same, so you can use template matching. Pair template matching with some mouse controls and you've got yourself a web-based bot!

To start, you will need a main image, and a template. You should take your template from the exact "thing" you are looking for in the image. I will provide an image as an example, but feel free to use an image of your favorite website or something like that.
