I've generated my own voice with AI! This is a relatively new technology and people have started generating not just celebrity voices, but entire musical pieces as well. The technology to generate sounds, both voices & music, has been rapidly improving the past few years thanks to deep learning. In this episode, I'll first demo some AI generated music. Then, i'll explain the physics of a waveform and how DeepMind used waveform-based data to generate some pretty realistic sounds in 2016. At the end, I'll describe the cutting edge of generative sound modeling, a paper released just 2 months ago called "MelNet". Enjoy!

Shoutout to 3blue1brown's amazing "Manim" library! I used it for the first time in this video, for the latex highlighting and for the brief neural network. Watch me get better at it in the next few weeks:
