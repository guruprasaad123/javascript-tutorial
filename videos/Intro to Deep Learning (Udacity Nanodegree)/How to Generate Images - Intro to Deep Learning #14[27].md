We're going to build a variational autoencoder capable of generating novel images after being trained on a collection of images. We'll be using handwritten digit images as training data. Then we'll both generate new digits and plot out the learned embeddings. And I introduce Bayesian theory for the first time in this series :)

2 things 
-The embedding visualization at the end would be more spread out if i trained it for more epochs (50 is recommended) but i just used 5.
-The code in the video doesn't fully implement the reparameterization trick (to save space) but check the GitHub repo for details on that.
