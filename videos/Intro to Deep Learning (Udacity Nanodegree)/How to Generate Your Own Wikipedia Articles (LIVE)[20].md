We're going to build an LSTM network in Tensorflow (no Keras) to generate text after training on Wikipedia articles. You'll learn how an LSTM cell works programmatically since we'll build one using TF's math functions and how you can parse a similar dataset

Dataset: https://metamind.io/research/the-wikitext-long-term-dependency-language-modeling-dataset/


Please subscribe! And like. And comment. That's what keeps me going.
