Welcome to FutureFest! This was School of AI's first ever conference that I hosted in Granada, Spain. I wanted to meet the faces of our learning community in person, to see the work they were doing, and celebrate the collective future we’re all striving towards. So I searched for Castle’s in Europe on Airbnb, and found a villa in Spain! Then I invited some of our most active community organizers to come to Spain and live in the Villa for 3 days. I had no idea what to expect, but it turned out to be a life changing experience. In this video, you'll see exclusive footage from the event and interviews with the attendees. Hopefully this inspires you to start thinking about ways that you too can use AI to make a positive impact in the world. Enjoy!
