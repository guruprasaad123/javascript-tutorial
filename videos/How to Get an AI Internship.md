This is a question I get asked a lot, so I've decided to make a video detailing how to get an AI internship. Internships are a great way to start a career in AI! They enable you to build a professional network and can be amazing learning experiences.  I'll list a ton of resources and discuss the most helpful steps in the process including creating a study plan, finding a relevant position, building a personal brand, leveraging your existing network, and practicing for interviews. Enjoy!
