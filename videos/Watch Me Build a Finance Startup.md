I've built an app called Artificial Advisor that helps you manage your personal finances. After connecting to your bank account, it automatically categorizes your transactions and helps you allocate a monthly budget. You can ask the app questions about your budget and it will also make automated investment decisions for you in several stocks in the industry of your choosing. In this lecture, i'll explain the code and thought process I used to build it so that you can build your own finance startup. I used Tensorflow + Firebase + Plaid + Dialogflow + Alpaca to build this. Enjoy!
