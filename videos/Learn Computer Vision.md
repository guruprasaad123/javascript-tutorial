I've designed a free curriculum to help anyone learn Computer Vision in the most efficient way possible! My curriculum starts off with low level vision techniques and progressively increases in difficulty until we get to high level analysis techniques i.e deep learning. Don't worry if you've never coded before, i've included links to help you learn Python as well. Now is the time to build computer vision solutions, the world needs these menial tasks automated to help liberate humans from drudgery. The tools needed are python, OpenCV, and Tensorflow, all of which have their place and I'll explain all the details of how it fits together in this video. Enjoy!
