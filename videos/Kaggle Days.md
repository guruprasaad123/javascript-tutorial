This past week Kaggle invited me to attend an event they hosted called Kaggle Days in Paris, France. Kaggle Days are a global series of offline events for seasoned data scientists and Kagglers. It was a lot of fun! I met some really interesting people from all over the world and the venue they booked is the biggest startup campus in the world (Station F). In this video, I'll introduce Kaggle Days, interview 5 top data scientists, and conclude with a demo from a top Kaggler on inventory prediction. Enjoy!
