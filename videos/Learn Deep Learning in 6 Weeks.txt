Deep Learning is the dark art of our times. Incredibly powerful, mysteriously accurate, and accessible to just about anyone. In this video, i've compiled an open source 6 week curriculum to help you learn deep learning using various sources from the Web. I'll describe all of my learning resources, why i chose them, and how they can help you. Starting with feedforward networks, to convolutional networks, recurrent networks, adversarial learning, and finally deep reinforcement learning. Enjoy!
