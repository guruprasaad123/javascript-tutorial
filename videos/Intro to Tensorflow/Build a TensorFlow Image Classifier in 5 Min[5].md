In this episode we're going to train our own image classifier to detect Darth Vader images. 

The code for this repository is here:

The Challenge: 
The challenge for this episode is to create your own Image Classifier that would be a useful tool for scientists. Just post a clone of this repo that includes your retrained Inception Model (label it output_graph.pb). If it's too big for GitHub, just upload it to DropBox and post the link in your GitHub README. I'm going to judge all of them and the winner gets a shoutout from me in a future video, as well as a signed copy of my book 'Decentralized Applications'.

This CodeLab by Google is super useful in learning this stuff:
