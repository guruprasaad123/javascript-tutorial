In this video, I go over some of the state of the art advances in music generation coming out of DeepMind. Then we build our own music generation script in Python using Tensorflow and a type of neural network called a Restricted Boltzmann Machine. Congrats to Rohan Verma (Winner) and Chih-Cheng Liang (runner-up) for their classifiers for scientists. The challenge for this video is to generate a happy/upbeat song using the RBM Script.
