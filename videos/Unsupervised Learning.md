Unsupervised learning is the most exciting subfield of machine learning! Finding structure in unstructured data automatically sounds like a dream come true, no need to have a label! In this video, I'll demonstrate 2 types of unsupervised learning techniques; k means clustering and principal component analysis. We'll use these techniques on neural data from a patient suffering from seizures to see if we can locate the part of their brain in need of surgery to save their life. You'll laugh, you'll cry, but most importantly, you'll learn. Enjoy!
