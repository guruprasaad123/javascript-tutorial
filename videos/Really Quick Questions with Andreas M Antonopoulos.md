Andreas M Antonopoulos is one of the most well-known and well-respected figures in bitcoin. He is the author of two books: “Mastering Bitcoin”, published by O’Reilly Media and considered the best technical guide to bitcoin and “The Internet of Money”, a book about why bitcoin matters. He's also host of the "Let's Talk Bitcoin" podcast, a serial entrepreneur, and a public speaker. Oh, and he's my new friend we literally just met here in Helsinki since we were invited to speak at Slush. We will likely co-author a book at some point on blockchain + AI applications. He only had 30 minutes to chat with me today and i managed to cram in an 8 minute interview in the coffeeshop. Hope you like it!
